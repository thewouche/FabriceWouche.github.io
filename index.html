									<p>This module will introduce you to the underpinning concepts and principles of Secure Systems Architecture (SSA). This includes a review of the evolution of traditional operating systems architecture models, common security models, and the impact of distributed systems technologies on modern systems. The course will provide you with a combination of an understanding of operating systems, distributed services and the security aspects of both. The module enables you to engage in debate to identify contemporary cyber security-based challenges and the ability to design appropriate solutions.</p>

									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/riskmanagement.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Security and risk are increasingly being treated as inseparable as enterprises move away from traditional siloed views of business towards more integrated, enterprise solutions. This module covers the various areas where security and risk overlap and interact with each other. Discussion about the various methods of risk assessment looking at both qualitative and quantitative methods. Discuss a number of more traditional risk models (such as STRIDE, DREAD and Attack Trees) as well as reviewing the increasing trend towards hybrid models. Review common security standards such as PCI-DSS and look at business continuity and disaster recovery solutions. In addition, discuss some of the key research topics and advances driving the fields of security and risk management.</p>
									</p>Learning Outcomes: Discuss the difference between qualitative and quantitative risk assessments - Describe how to carry out both kinds of assessments - Explain what is meant by and how to create threat models - Demonstrate how to create quantitative risk models - Discuss and design DR solutions.</p>
